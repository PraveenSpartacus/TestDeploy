                    India is witnessing an upsurge of technology-driven and knowledge-based enterprises. it is the field of conventional business or in IT and ITES a sudden spurt in the number of new ventures or start-ups has taken the country by surprise. Technology and Innovation are playing a major role in this process. It is as if all of sudden people, especially the young ones are no longer afraid to dream an idea and work actively to convert their ideas to commercially viable business.

            While a few years back, the conversion of idea to product might have sounded a distant dream, with both technology and market being uncertain, things certainly have changed now. More and more technocrats, students with practically no experience or industry experienced professionals are giving shape to their business ideas. It is as if the Silicon Valley story is reincarnating itself in India.<br><br>

Encouraged by the motivating ecosystem students are no longer giving preference to campus placements and are going for deferred placement to give a chance to their dream projects. It has however been seen that initial support to the start-ups has been one of the deterrent in the process of the launch. Students (their parents) have already incurred a heavy expenditure for the payment of tuition fees and subsistence and are cash strapped.

                    New Generation Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Centre (NewGen IEDC) is the programme launched by National Science and Technology Entrepreneurship Development Board (NSTEDB), Department of Science & Technology (DST), Government of India and implemented by EDII, Ahmedabad.
                    NewGen IEDC aims to inculcate the spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship amongst the young S&T students, encourage and support start-up creation through guidance, mentorship & support. NewGen IEDCs would be established in academic institutions where students will be encouraged to take up innovative projects with possibility of commercialization.

        <div class="text2 animateU" id="eletex2">
            NewGen IEDCs would also spread the message of entrepreneurship and create a culture of entrepreneurship in the Host Institution (HI). With faculty already trained in the nuances of entrepreneurship, the presence of NewGen IEDCs in HI would create a vibrant entrepreneurial culture amongst the students. Few amongst the “Job-Seekers” would be converted to “Job-Generators” through the entrepreneurial route.
